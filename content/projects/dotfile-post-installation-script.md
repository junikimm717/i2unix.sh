Dotfiles should be accessible anywhere on any computer.

## Task

Make a shell script (coupled with your dotfiles) that installs all of your
favorite programs and copies your dotfiles to the correct locations.

I expect the following:

1. **Copy** all of your dotfiles correctly
2. Install programs that you use and any dependencies.
3. (Optional) Use the latest versions of programs/build them from upstream if
   the distribution has outdated program versions.
4. (Optional) Adapt your script for 2 or more different distros. For example,
   you might configure it for Ubuntu or Red Hat.

## Resources

I made a pretty expansive version of this
[myself](https://git.junickim.me/junikimm717/serverconfigs).
