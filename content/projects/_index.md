# Projects

In general, these prompts will ask for you to perform some specific tasks. At
the bare minimum, I want all of the features that I requested implemented in one
way or another. These requirements will become less specific as time goes on
because I expect you to inject some of your creativity into your projects.

As you become more and more accustomed to the language of what makes for a good
interaction with your computer, you can begin tailoring your programs around
that.

Be ambitious, but try to stick to the realm of things that are actually possible
to implement. You will also get a sense of this with time.
