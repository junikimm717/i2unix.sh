## Task

Figure out an effective way to scrape
[bballreference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) to compare players and
games. This is a bit more of an open project, but you should aim to create
either a CLI Utility or a simple site.

## Some Ideas

- Empirically figure out which players have better career numbers.
- Make statistical predictions about how teams will do this year.
