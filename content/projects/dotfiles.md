Dotfiles are essential for any programmer; they represent all of their own
tastes when interacting with a computer.

## Task

Similar to [classwork repository](http://localhost:1313/projects/repo/).
All elements there should be included, along with a couple of additional
elements:

1. A vim or neovim configuration file
2. A bashrc file
3. (Optional) A script to copy all config files from their original spots to
   your repository. It should basically update this repository with your latest
   config files.

I would like proof that you actually tried to do some configuration (Ctrl
C-V'ing sections is fine, but you need to show it's what you've been working with).

If you did option 3, I would like proof that the updating script works.
