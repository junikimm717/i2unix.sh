Since CLI and Vim skills only get better with practice, I recommend that you
use git to hold and synchronize your schoolwork. Although you won't be able to
use a markup compiler until Unit 3, you can, in the meantime, use it as a way to
save revisions of assignments (in plain text files) and the like.

Get into the habit of making small commits with meaningful messages and
organizing your repository into folders with specific functions.

## Task

Create a git repository, either for schoolwork or for the projects that we will do in
the future. Upload it to the cloud so that I can see what you did.

I expect the following to be present:

1. A gitignore file
2. A README with appropriate information on the repository
3. A LICENSE file explaining what others can do with your repository.

## Resources

Most of [my repositories](https://github.com/MAA-Contest-Tester/website) follow
this format.

You can check out the [gitignore
documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) to understand its mechanism
and common patterns.
