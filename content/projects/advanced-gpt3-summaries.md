## Task

Figure out how to manipulate the external OpenAI API to provide summaries of
articles from certain sources. You must implement scraping and preferably give
the user the ability to choose from a list of possible options.

## Bonus

- Implement Caching
- Turn it into a web app, or use serverless functions (AWS Lambda, GCP, ...).

### Extra Requirements

- You must keep your API keys secret.
