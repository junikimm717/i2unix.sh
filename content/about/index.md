{{< img src="profile.jpg" width="200" alt="Profile" center="center" >}}

I am a junior at Stanford Online High School who spends almost (no, all) of his
free time doing whatever programming project interests him at the time. Mostly,
this has either been in web development or hacking Linux systems (either
developing new scripts or ricing out my desktop).

During my freshman year, I was introduced to the vim text editor, and, once I
joined our school's Unix club (The Open Source Cult), I have never looked back.

Notable Projects I have done:

- [TeXbld](https://texbld.com), a build tool for reproducibly compiling markup
  (started from the pains of using LaTeX).
- [MkTeX](https://github.com/junikimm717/mktex), the predecessor to TeXbld.
- [The MAA Contest Tester](https://maatester.com), a math contest prep tool.
- [My School's Math Club Website](https://ohsmathc.club)

Notable Configurations I have set up:

- [NixOS Dotfiles](https://github.com/junikimm717/nixosdots), declaratively
  setup configurations with the nix package manager (Using Flakes &#9829;)
- [My Post-Installation Scripts](https://git.junickim.me/junikimm717/serverconfigs)
- [Guix Dotfiles](https://git.junickim.me/junikimm717/guixconfigs)
- A custom network of home servers that sync up my schoolwork and serve as NASes
  and Git servers. I managed to repurpose a 13-year-old computer sitting in the
  dust for this task!

Outside of programming, I do a lot of olympiads (the more math, the better).
I [won the 2022
USAJMO](https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/AMC/usamo/2022/2022%20USAJMO%20Awardees.docx%20%281%29.pdf)
placing 22nd and qualified for USACO Platinum and USNCO Nationals. Having to
_grok_ knowledge in both olympiads and Unix has heavily influenced the way I
think about problems (and I hope the same for you as well, if you're taking this class).
