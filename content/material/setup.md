Make sure that your computer boots and runs properly. Since you're likely using
an OEM machine, it should immediately prompt you to create your username and
password (do as you wish here).

The prompt may also ask you to connect to other online accounts. Personally, I
would prefer not to do this (this is not Microsoft), but you can if you want to.
